# CLICKR
A short clickr game.
# HOW TO INSTALL
Step 1: Download the source code.
Step 2: https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/ follow those directions lol.
Step 3: You're done.
# HOW TO COMPILE
There will be something on the Visual Studio Code screen saying Lime HTML5 (If not then something went wrong...)
Click on the HTML5 button and a drop-down menu should appear. With that drop-down menu, you can select what target you want to build to.
Once you choose a target, then press CTRL SHIFT and B all at the same time and it will build! (Unless you have en erron then thats ur problem lol)
# Conclusion
thats it.
